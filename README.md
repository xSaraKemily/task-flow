# Task Flow (in development)

This is a task manager project developed for my portfolio. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, but it does not have database integration, meaning data is not persisted after reloading the page. The focus was on implementing the logic and user interface.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies used: Angular, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Typescript, HTML, CSS

ðŸ“Œ Features:

- Dark and Light mode
- Add tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks

# TaskFlow

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
