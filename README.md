# Task Flow (in development)

This is a task manager project developed for my portfolio. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, but it does not have database integration, meaning data is not persisted after reloading the page. The focus was on implementing the logic and user interface.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies used: Angular, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Typescript, HTML, CSS

ðŸ“Œ Features:

- Dark and Light mode
- Add tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
